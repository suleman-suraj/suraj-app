               <h2>Transformation through education</h2>
               <h5>Every individual has the potential to create change, whether in their life, their community, or the world. The transformative power of education is what unlocks that potential. Yet, access to high-quality education has been a privilege of the few. Back in 2012, we realized it was a time for a seismic shift in learning. From the tried and true to the leading edge. From “for some” to “for all.” By opening the classroom through online learning, edX empowers millions of learners to unlock their potential and become changemakers.</h5>
               <h2>Our mission</h2>
               <h4>There are three commitments we've made to the world. We've been grounded by these since day one:</h4>
               <ul>
                   <li>Increase access to high-quality education for everyone, everywhere</li>
                   <li>Enhance teaching and learning on campus and online</li>
                   <li>Advance teaching and learning through research</li>
               </ul>
            </div>
